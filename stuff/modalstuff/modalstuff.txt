<div id="p1">This is the first site I've put online for commercial use. It only uses simple LAMP stack and
Paypal API to process payments. It taught me a lot about PHP, MySQL and Paypal API. It was shut down due
to the fact that I can no longer get the deals for cheap car rentals.</div>

<div id="p2">Here is the second site that was built shortly before the first site was shut down. This website
is mainly using JavaScript and CSS, with the help of my friend Wari, this website was quickly drafted up. However,
before any real implementation was done, it was abandoned because I can not longer receive cheap car rental deals.</div>

<div id="p3">After nearly a year of constant struggle and distraction, I'm finally focusing on studying web development
back in December. This is the second website I've built, it's simple, it only shows the basic understandings of
CSS and jQuery.</div>

<div id="p4">Another page demonstrating a more extensive use of jQuery. At this point, I'm pretty comfortable of
chaining, looping, apply effects to individual items, even while in loop. Some CSS was used. Beginning to learn how to
write mobile responsive sites. (This is kind of mobile responsive)</div>

<div id="p5">This page is the beginning of getting into AngularJS, demonstrating simple data binding. At this time,
I've also discovered bootstrap css and bootstrap js and started to put to use.</div>

<div id="p6">More in depth study of AngularJS. Routes, directives, modules, the topic is deep. To start, it's easy, but
the learning curve is steep once I get my foot wet. I've combined PHP to query a MySQL database in real time using
AngularJS, using routes to carry the data around the page. Work in Progress.</div>

<div id="p7">Changed a little direction in learning more front-end designs, using ScrollMagic, I can make elements
animate according to the position of current scroll pixel. The page also demonstrates a very simple triangulation
technique using Google Maps API. This shows how vulnerable you may be even if only your distance is shown in some
social apps.</div>
