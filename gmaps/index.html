        <h3>Triangulation is a very powerful way to track your location.<br>
        A computer or a mobile device tracks its location automatically
        by continuously sending signals to the Wifi hub or cell towers to ask the
        distance from the device by how strong or weak the current signal is.<br>
        You know you can also do this to track other people? <br>Same idea. <br>In social
        apps like Wechat, or Momo, and thousands of apps out there, there are features
        such as "People Nearby" or "Look around" etc. <br>Usually the exact location of
        the people that appeared on those social apps are hidden, but they do give off
        approximate location. <br>Take example such as Wechat:</h3>
