        <h3>Triangulation can be a very powerful way to track your location.
        In normal Wifi tracking situation, a computer determines it's location
        automatically by continuously sending signals to the Wifi hub to ask the
        distance between the computer by how strong or weak the current signal is.
        You know you can also do this to track other people? Same idea. In social
        apps like Wechat, or Momo, and thousands of apps out there, there are features
        such as "People Nearby" or "Look around" etc. Usually the exact location of
        the people that appeared on those social apps are hidden, but they do give off
        approximate location. Take example such as Wechat:</h3>
